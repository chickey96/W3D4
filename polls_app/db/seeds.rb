# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# users = User.create([{username: "alec"}])
# polls = Poll.create([{author_id: 1, title: "ice cream"}])
# questions = Question.create([{text: "what is your favorite ice cream"}, {poll_id: 1}])

# users = User.create([{username: "alec"}])
# polls = Poll.create([{author_id: 1, title: "ice cream"}])
#  AnswerChoice.create([{question_id: 1, answer: "Mochi"}])
# AnswerChoice.create([{question_id: 1, answer: "I hate icecream"}])
#  AnswerChoice.create([{question_id: 2, answer: "Once a year"}])
# AnswerChoice.create([{question_id: 2, answer: "Everyday"}])
